# Recurring Events in Elixir (Phoenix)
Source code for my Medium article ["Recurring Events in Elixir (Phoenix): OptimalÂ Querying"](https://jakecurreri.medium.com/)

## Setup

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser. Huzzah.
